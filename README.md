# Jangaroo Papers

A repository to host journal or conference papers around Jangaroo

While these papers are a bit dated, they may still serve to grasp the idea behind Jangaroo, so we decided to share them freely.

PLASTIC2011 contains a paper (LaTeX, Word, PDF) as well as the slides shown in the workshop presentation (PPTX).

FlashCoders NY was a presentation held remotely for a Flash community meetup.

sosocon and OSMB were draft and abstract for a conference that unfortunately was cancelled.
